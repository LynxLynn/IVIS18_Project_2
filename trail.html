      <h1 id="trailInfoU">Data Gathering</h1>
      <center><p style="max-width:40%; text-align:center; line-height: 1.5;">The goal of WVS is to gather data and show that data to the world, by asking people what they think about certain values and beliefs. I went through that survey data with the quest to find some interesting variables and ended up with data from eight variables for 36 chosen countries over the years 1995-2014.
      <p style="font-style:italic; max-width:40%;"><b>Chosen countries:</b> Aims of country: first choice, Environment vs economic growth, Confidence: The armed forces, Employment status, State of health, Feeling of happiness, Trust in people, Income equality<p>
      </br>
      With this, I want to creat a visualization where you can easily see and analyze data from different countries.

      <center><p style="max-width:40%; text-align:center; line-height: 1.5;">To get a good overview of the data I had collected I started with a map of the world, where the countries with available data is marked with a blue color(See Fig.1). If we “zoom-in” and investigate the map further we can see that hovering over a country give you it’s name(See Fig.2), and by clicking on it a table with the available data is presented just below the map(See Fig.3). By swapping country and variables you can see and compare the different answers throughout the years.
      I thought it could be, and found it interesting to compare each variable per country with the world average of each variable. Are they similar to each other? or is there a huge different when it comes to certain questions? So,as you can see in figure 4, just below the table of data for each country you can click on a specific variable and get a graph with the world average. With the two different data sets showing, you can compare and see if there are any big differences(See Fig.4).

      <h1 id="trailInfoU">Analytic Trail 2 <p style="font-size:12px;font-weight:normal;">(Not implemented in visualization)</p></h1>
      <center><p style="max-width:40%; text-align:center; line-height: 1.5;">Data from one source it great, but to be able to compare that data with another source is even greater. So to make the collected data more interesting I (hypothetically) combined my WVS data with data from Gapminder. This to investigate if, for example, a country that finds protecting the environment important has a small or large CO2 footprint/consumption. Which takes the interesting factor of the data one step further.</p></center>
      <h1 id="trailInfoU">Learning outcome</h1>
      <center><p style="max-width:40%; text-align:center; line-height: 1.5;">
        Even though it has been interesting to investigate the data from WVS and Gapminder, the visualization of that data has been quite difficult. But with that, I have learned some things.
        <li style="max-width:30%;">I have gotten more familiar with the visualization tool D3, but I still got a lot to learn.</li>
        <li style="max-width:30%;">Practiced my (very new and very small) skill in data transformation, mapping visual structures and their view transformation.</li>
        <li style="max-width:30%;">Managing bigger collections of data (the data per say was perhaps not that big, but there were many files to manage) </li>
